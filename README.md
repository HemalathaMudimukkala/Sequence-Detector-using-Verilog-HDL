# Sequence-Detector-using-Verilog-HDL
This project implements a sequence detector using Verilog HDL, designed to identify a specific pattern of bits, such as "1010," in a continuous stream of binary input data. The sequence detector operates as a finite state machine (FSM), with defined states and transitions to accurately detect the target sequence. The design is verified through a comprehensive testbench that simulates various input sequences to ensure correct functionality. This modular and synthesis-ready Verilog HDL code can be easily adapted for FPGA or ASIC implementations, making it a practical example of digital design in signal processing or communication systems.
